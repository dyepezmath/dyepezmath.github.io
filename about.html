            <h1>History and Hobbies</h1>
            <p>
            I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Philosophy at the California State University in Chico from 2012 to 2016. 
            I then moved to Cambridge to study Philosophy at Harvard with 
            <a href="https://philosophy.fas.harvard.edu/people/peter-koellner">Peter Koellner</a> 
            as a Research Scholar. 
            In 2019 I received my Master's in Data Science from the University of the Pacific.

            Over the years I have collected a variety of hobbies and interest, the following are some of them: soccer, boxing, snowboarding, mountain-biking, weight-lifting, chess, and board games (to name a few). 
            Although, these days I spend large portions of my time in dog parks (see below).

            <h3>Dogs</h3>
            <p>
            I have two dogs: Woody and Jessie. 
            Woody is a german shepherd - basset hound mix, and Jessie is an australian shepherd - husky mix.
